## Description

This package includes a new strand base hair system that integrated from the [AMD’s TressFX](https://gpuopen.com/announcing-unity-china-hairfx/) hair system. This hair system supports both Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). Our goal is that this real-time strand hair simulation and rendering system support for cross platform from desktop computer, consoles to mobile devices.

While this hair system has a lot more work remains to be done, we’re sharing what we have at the moment. You’re free to use or modify it to fit your productions and build if needed.
